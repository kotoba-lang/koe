  "The audio side of a live call: the carrier's frames, and knowing when the
  caller has finished a sentence.

  A media stream is not a recording. It arrives as a continuous run of 20 ms
  frames whether or not anybody is talking, and nothing in it says 'that was an
  utterance'. Deciding where one ends is this namespace's job, and it is the
  decision the whole turn hangs on: end it too early and the receptionist
  answers half a sentence; too late and it sits there while the caller waits.

  ## Pure, because it has to be testable without a telephone

  Frames in, frames out, and a segmenter that is a fold over frames. The
  WebSocket, the file handling and the HTTP call to the speech engine are the
  host's. Everything here can be driven from a vector of frames in a test, which
  is the only way any of it gets exercised before a carrier account exists.

  ## μ-law, kept as μ-law

  The carrier sends 8 kHz μ-law and takes 8 kHz μ-law back. A host that renders
  its lines ahead of time in that same format never converts audio on the call. Audio coming in is decoded to linear only to measure
  loudness — the bytes handed to the speech engine are the original ones."
