  "How the call got here, and whether the number attached to it is the caller's.

  ## The premise that broke this

  A restaurant already has a telephone number and their customers dial it. The
  cheapest way to put a receptionist behind it — and the first way this will be
  deployed — is for the shop to **forward** their existing line to ours. Nothing
  about the conversation changes. What changes is who the presented number
  belongs to.

  On a directly dialled call, the network's caller ID is the caller. On a
  forwarded call it may be the caller, or it may be **the forwarding line
  itself** — the restaurant's own number — depending on whether that carrier
  passes the original in a Diversion, P-Asserted-Identity or Remote-Party-ID
  header. It is not guaranteed, it varies by carrier and by country, and it is
  exactly the kind of thing that works in the first test because the test dialled
  directly.

  ## Why this is worse than a missing number

  A dialog typically treats the caller's contact as a fact already in hand and
  therefore never asks for it. Fed a forwarded call whose caller ID is the shop's
  own line, it would seal *the restaurant's number* as the way to reach the
  customer, on every booking, confidently, without ever asking — and the 予約
  would look completely well-formed. A missing number produces one more question.
  A wrong one produces a table held for somebody nobody can reach.

  So a number becomes a fact only when its provenance says it is the caller's:

    :network-caller     the network asserts this is the calling party
    :diverted-unknown   the call was diverted and the original was not passed
    :withheld           the caller withheld it

  Only the first is used. And a presented number equal to the line that forwarded
  the call is treated as `:diverted-unknown` no matter what the provenance
  claims — a carrier that fills the Diversion header with the diverting number
  is not telling us who called."
